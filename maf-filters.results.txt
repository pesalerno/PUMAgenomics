PUMA things:

When filtering loci with less than 60% of individuals sampled and 
individuals with less than 50% data: 
before final filter: 28766 SNPs
# individuals filtered: 1 of 135 individuals

MAF 0.01 filter: 17821 SNPs

MAF 0.02: 16256 SNPs

MAF 0.05: 13925 SNPs



When filtering out loci with less than 75% individuals sampled: 20355 SNPs
# individuals filtered: 1 of 135 individuals

MAF 0.01: 12786 SNPs

MAF 0.02: 11915 SNPs

MAF 0.05: 10315 SNPs

I AM KEEPING THE ONE WITH LESS MISSING DATA.
